Mil-OSS MIL-STD-2525 working group

Trying something new here.  We're finally convinced it's time to solve the 2525* dynamic iconagraphy
rendering problem once and for all.  A pure OSS solution is the answer - not proprietary, or government
program-controlled options.

Want to help?  We're just now organizing the working group.  Let us know you're interested.

What are the current options?

What's the benefit of having an open source option?
