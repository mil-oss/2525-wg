# 2525-wg

Mil-OSS MIL-STD-2525 working group

Trying something new here.  We're finally convinced it's time to solve the 2525* dynamic iconagraphy
rendering problem once and for all.  A pure OSS solution is the answer - not proprietary, or government
program-controlled options.

Want to help?  We're just now organizing the working group.  Let us know you're interested.

## Questions

What is really needed?

First, a maintainable and discoverable catalog of all solutions and players.  Then, the opportunities will identify themselves.

* Web services (REST/RPC, WS)
* Libraries (language native)
* Collections
* Consolidated efforts!
