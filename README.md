Mil-OSS MIL-STD-2525 working group

Trying something new here.  We're finally convinced it's time to solve the 2525* dynamical iconagraphy
rendering problem once and for all.  A pure OSS solution is the answer - not proprietary, or government
program-controlled options.

Want to help?  We're just now organizing the working group.  Let us know you're interested.
