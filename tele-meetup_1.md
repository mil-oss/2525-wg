----

Chaim mentioned that he has an old 2525 SVG set.  We're going to work on getting it repo'd here, then broadcast it.  Maybe find the o.g. owner - at least make an attempt to be a good citizen.

(I've given Chaim dev access to this repo already - KP)

I believe we also agreed to use Github, and Github's Pages feature to host content (e.g. catalog and the meeting notes.) 

(I'll work on getting this initialized, then those who want to can either request dev access to edit directly, or provide patches - KP)

(John and I will continue to reach out to known developers and evangelize - KP)

(I will follow up with Gene directly to discuss [Codice Foundation](http://codice.org) and see if there is an opportunity to help get the word out about Ortellium and the great work they've done - KP)
